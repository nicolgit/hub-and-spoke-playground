This repo contains a preconfigured Azure hub-and-spoke network topology, aligned to the Azure enterprise-scale landing zone reference architecture, deployable with a click on your subscription, useful for testing and studying network configurations in a controlled, repeatable environment.

As bonus many scenarios with step-by-step solutions for studying and learning are also available.

> _Read also this [blog post](https://nicolgit.github.io/azure-hub-and-spoke-playground/) for more info on this project._

The "playground" is composed by:
  * two hub and spoke network topologies aligned with with <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/enterprise-scale/architecture" target="_blank">Microsoft Enterprise scale landing zone</a> reference architecture
  * two simulated on-premise architectures, deployed in 2 different regions, composed by network, client machine(s) and a gateway

## Deploy to Azure
You can use the following buttons to deploy the demo environment to your Azure subscription:

The ARM template [any-to-any](any-to-any-bicep/any-to-any.json) deploys:
* 2 routing tables that forward all spokes traffic to the firewall
* 1 IP Group and one Azure Firewall policy that:
  * allows spoke-to-spoke communication
  * block certain sites using web categories: nudity, Child Inappropriate, pornography
  * allows all remaining HTTP(S) outbound traffic

The site to site VPN connection shown in the architecture is not automatically deployed and configure: its configuration is covered by one of the playground scenarios.**est solution**
All machines have the same account parameters (as following):
* username: `nicola`
* password: `password.123`

## Playground's scenarios
Here there is a list of tested scenarios usable on this playground.

For each scenario you have:

* **prerequisites**: component to deploy required to implement the solution (only the hub, also one on-prem playground or both)
* **solution**: a step-by-step sequence to implement the solution
* **test solution**: a procedure to follow, to verify if the scenario is working as expected
