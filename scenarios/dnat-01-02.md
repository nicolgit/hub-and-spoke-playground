# SOLUTION: DNAT - expose on public IP, via RDP (port 3389) machines spoke-01-vm and spoke-02-vm

## Pre-requisites

In order to apply this solution you have to deploy hub playground only.

## Solution
When you install Azure Firewall, it has only one public IP. In order to access via Remote Virtual Desktop, on the same port 2 machines, as first step an additional public IP is required.

So, from Azure Portal:
* create a new public IP.
* in `lab-firewall` select Public IP Configuration
* Add a public IP configuration
* take note of the 2 public IP

| Name   | Public IP |
|--------|-----------|
|IpConf  | `x.x.x.x` |
|IpConf2 | `y.y.y.y` |

Create the following Firewall Policy: `hub-fw-policy`

**DNAT rules**

|priority | collection name | rule name | src | port | protocol | destination | translated address| translated port | action |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1000     | coll01          |rdp-spk-01 | *   | 3389 | TCP      | `x.x.x.x`   | 10.13.1.4         | 3389            | Dnat   |
|1000     | coll01          |rdp-spk-02 | *   | 3389 | TCP      | `y.y.y.y`   | 10.13.2.4         | 3389            | Dnat   |

Associate the policy `hub-fw-policy` to `lab-firewall` via Firewall Manager

## Test Solution

Test connection using RRP client from a machine on internet to `x.x.x.x` and `y.y.y.y`.
